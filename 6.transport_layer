Services of transport layer
As layer four of the OSI model, the transport layer is responsible for providing communication services between computers on a network. 
For example, as the data packets transit between the originating or sending computer and the destination or receiving computer, the 
transport layer performs error checking and data packet routing services. Additionally, while working with the three lower and three 
upper layers, the transport layer continues to provide services, even though different application software processes are running 
simultaneously on multiple computers.
