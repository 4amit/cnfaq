1.Medium Access Control Layer?
The Media Access Control Layer is one of two sublayers that make up the Data Link Layer of the OSI model. The MAC layer is responsible for moving data packets to and from one Network Interface Card (NIC) to another across a shared channel.

2.Multiple Access Protocols
ALOHA:
    In the 1970s, Norman Abramson and his colleagues at the
University of Hawaii devised a new and elegant method to
solve the channel allocation problem. ALOHA in Hawaiian
 means “hello”.
    Two versions of ALOHA : pure and slotted.
    They differ with respect to whether time is divided into
discrete slots into which all frames must fit.
    Pure ALOHA does not require global time synchronization;
slotted ALOHA does.

Pure ALOHA
    Each station sends a frame whenever it has
a frame to send.
    However, since there is only one channel to
share, there is the possibility of collision
between frames from different stations.

3.Carrier Sense Multiple access protocol
Protocol in which station listen for carrier and act accordingly are called carrier sense protocols
 1-persistent method
         The station finds the line idle, it sends its
         frame immediately (with probability 1).
         This method has the highest chance of collision
         because two or more stations may find the line
         idle and send their frames immediately.
 nonpersistent method
          If a station that has a frame to send it senses the line.
           If the line is idle, it sends immediately.
           If the line is not idle, it waits a random amount of time and then
          senses the line again.
           The nonpersistent approach reduces the chance of collision
          because it is unlikely that two or more stations will wait the
          same amount of time and retry to send simultaneously.
           However, this method reduces the efficiency of the network
          because the medium remains idle when there may be stations
          with frames to send.
 p-persistent method
          The p-persistent method is used if the channel
          has time slots with a slot duration equal to or
          greater than the maximum propagation time
          In this method, after the station finds the line idle
          it follows these steps:
          1. With probability p, the station sends its frame.
          2. With probability q = 1 - p, the station waits for the
             beginning of the next time slot and checks the line
             again.
             a. If the line is idle, it goes to step 1.
             b. If the line is busy, it acts as though a collision
                  has occurred and uses the back-off procedure
