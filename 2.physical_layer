4.What is switching and categories of Switching?
  Switching is process to forward packets coming in from one port to a port leading towards the destination. 
  When data comes on a port it is called ingress, and when data leaves a port or goes out it is called egress.
  A communication system may include number of switches and nodes. At broad level, 
  switching can be divided into two major categories:

  1.Connectionless: The data is forwarded on behalf of forwarding tables. No previous handshaking is required 
    and acknowledgements are optional.

  2.Connection Oriented:  Before switching data to be forwarded to destination, there is a need to pre-establish 
    circuit along the path between both endpoints. Data is then forwarded on that circuit. After the transfer is 
    completed, circuits can be kept for future use or can be turned down immediately.

5.What are the types of switching?
   1.Circuit Switching
   2.Message Switching
   3.Packet Switching
   
6.What is Circuit Switching?
   When two nodes communicate with each other over a dedicated communication path, it is called circuit 
   switching.There 'is a need of pre-specified route from which data will travels and no other data is 
   permitted.In circuit switching, to transfer the data, circuit must be established so that the data transfer can take place.
   Circuits can be permanent or temporary. Applications which use circuit switching may have to go through three phases:

   1.Establish a circuit
   2.Transfer the data
   3.Disconnect the circuit
   
   Circuit switching was designed for voice applications. Telephone is the best suitable example of 
   circuit switching. Before a user can make a call, a virtual path between caller and callee is established over the network.
   
7.What is Message Switching?
   This technique was somewhere in middle of circuit switching and packet switching. In message 
   switching, the whole message is treated as a data unit and is switching / transferred in its entirety.
   A switch working on message switching, first receives the whole message and buffers it until there are 
   resources available to transfer it to the next hop. If the next hop is not having enough resource to 
   accommodate large size message, the message is stored and switch waits.
   
   This technique was considered substitute to circuit switching. As in circuit switching the whole path 
   is blocked for two entities only. Message switching is replaced by packet switching. 
   Message switching has the following drawbacks:

   1.Every switch in transit path needs enough storage to accommodate entire message.
   2.Because of store-and-forward technique and waits included until resources are available, 
     message switching is very slow.
   3.Message switching was not a solution for streaming media and real-time applications.
   
8.What is Packet Switching?
   Shortcomings of message switching gave birth to an idea of packet switching. 
   The entire message is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. The switching 
   information is added in the header of each packet and transmitted independently.

   It is easier for intermediate networking devices to store small size packets and they 
   do not take much resources either on carrier path or in the internal memory of switches.
   
   Packet switching enhances line efficiency as packets from multiple applications can be 
   multiplexed over the carrier. The internet uses packet switching technique. 
   Packet switching enables the user to differentiate data streams based on priorities. 
   Packets are stored and forwarded according to their priority to provide quality of service.
   
 9.What is Multiplexing?
   Multiplexing is a technique by which different analog and digital streams of transmission 
   can be simultaneously processed over a shared link. Multiplexing divides the high capacity 
   medium into low capacity logical medium which is then shared by different streams.

   Communication is possible over the air (radio frequency), using a physical media (cable), 
   and light (optical fiber). All mediums are capable of multiplexing.

   When multiple senders try to send over a single medium, a device called Multiplexer 
   divides the physical channel and allocates one to each. On the other end of communication, 
   a De-multiplexer receives data from a single medium, identifies each, and sends to different receivers.
   
10.What is Frequency Division Multiplexing?
   When the carrier is frequency, FDM is used. FDM is an analog technology. FDM divides the spectrum or 
   carrier bandwidth in logical channels and allocates one user to each channel. Each user can use the 
   channel frequency independently and has exclusive access of it. All channels are divided in such a way 
   that they do not overlap with each other. Channels are separated by guard bands. Guard band is a frequency 
   which is not used by either channel.
   
11.What is Time Division Multiplexing?
   TDM is applied primarily on digital signals but can be applied on analog signals as well.   
   In TDM the shared channel is divided among its user by means of time slot. Each user can transmit 
   data within the provided time slot only. Digital signals are divided in frames, equivalent to time slot i.e. 
   frame of an optimal size which can be transmitted in given time slot.

   TDM works in synchronized mode. Both ends, i.e. Multiplexer and De-multiplexer are timely 
   synchronized and both switch to next channel simultaneously.
   When channel A transmits its frame at one end,the De-multiplexer provides media to channel A on the other end.
   As soon as the channel Aâ€™s time slot expires, this side switches to channel B. On the other end, 
   the De-multiplexer works in a synchronized manner and provides media to channel B. 
   Signals from different channels travel the path in interleaved manner.
   
12.What is Wavelength Division Multiplexing?
   Light has different wavelength (colors). In fiber optic mode, multiple optical carrier signals are multiplexed 
   into an optical fiber by using different wavelengths. 
   This is an analog multiplexing technique and is done conceptually in the same manner as FDM but uses light as signals.
   Further, on each wavelength time division multiplexing can be incorporated to accommodate more data signals.

13.What is Code Division Multiplexing?
   Multiple data signals can be transmitted over a single frequency by using Code Division Multiplexing. 
   FDM divides the frequency in smaller channels but CDM allows its users to full bandwidth and transmit 
   signals all the time using a unique code. CDM uses orthogonal codes to spread signals.

   Each station is assigned with a unique code, called chip. Signals travel with these codes independently, 
   inside the whole bandwidth.The receiver knows in advance the chip code signal it has to receive.
